This is called time complexity. In this model, we consider that each basic operation (addition,\nmultiplication, comparison, assignment, etc.) takes a fixed amount of time, and we count the number of such\noperations. We can usually express this number as a function of the size of the input, which we call n. And sadly,\nthis number usually grows to infinity with n (if it doesn't, we say that the algorithm is O(1)). We separate our\nalgorithms in big speed classes defined by Big-O : when we speak about a \"O(n^2) algorithm\", we mean that the\nnumber of operations it performs, expressed as a function of n, is a O(n^2). This says that our algorithm is\napproximately as fast as an algorithm that would do a number of operations equal to the square of the size of its\ninput, or faster. The \"or faster\" part is there because I used Big-O instead of Big-Theta, but usually people will say\nBig-O to mean Big-Theta.\nGoalKicker.com – Algorithms Notes for Professionals 9\nWhen counting operations, we usually consider the worst case: for instance if we have a loop that can run at most n\ntimes and that contains 5 operations, the number of operations we count is 5n.
